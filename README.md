This is another **additionnal** support project of `ST25TB series NFC tags for fun in French public transports` [ST25TB_transport.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gentilkiwi/st25tb_kiemul/main/ST25TB_transport.pdf) - it is based on [st25tb_kiemul](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/st25tb_kiemul) & [st25tb_kameleon](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/st25tb_kameleon) projects.


## Project

`st25tb_kiwi` project is ready for Texas Intruments Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE 12+, https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO. You can use the local IDE or the online one (CCS Cloud).

## Battery

As the board is small & light, the support for batteries is limited. You can solder a CR2032 holder for a `LIR2032` battery, but also `LP401730` or `LP402535` via a female Picoblade connector.

## Kiwi board

To practice, for POC, and for the lulz, a mini-board is also/will be available: https://oshwlab.com/gentilkiwi/st25tb_kiwi
